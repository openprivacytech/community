## About OpenPrivacyTech

OpenPrivacyTech is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit open-source organization dedicated to democratizing privacy technology and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Our mission is to make privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) accessible to everyone through education, research, and advocacy. Our goal is to advance the field of privacy tech by conducting research, identifying emerging trends and technologies, developing standards and infrastructure for the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). We work with researchers, data scientists, developers, policymakers, industry leaders, and organizations to advocate for strong data privacy and protection laws while promoting the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). 

At OpenPrivacyTech, we firmly believe in the critical importance of protecting individual privacy, and we are dedicated to promoting privacy tech adoption and joined the movement toward building and adopting for privacy-enhacing technologies. By collaborating with key stakeholders and promoting best practices in privacy tech, we are working to build a safer, more equitable digital future for all. 

We are excited to participate in the Season of Docs 2023 program and hire technical writers to create and update our documentation and technical content, such as contributor and onboarding guides, tutorials, technical resources, blog posts, and over all organizations open source project documentations . We believe in open source, adopting open standards, and building an open community to raise awareness of emerging privacy-enhancing technologies. By participating in the Season of Docs, we hope to support our contributors and technical writers and help grow our nonprofit initiative.


### About Project
---

####  Project Problem


Our Documentation project is an Apache 2.0 licensed initiative that aims to improve our documentation, onboarding process, and technical content such as technical blogs and tutorials. Our goal is to enable privacy researchers, data scientists, developers, policymakers, industry leaders, and organizations to use and contribute to our project and advance the field of privacy tech and privacy-enhancing technologies. To achieve this objective, we plan to join the Season of Docs program and publish state-of-the-art reports on privacy tech and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), as well as open research/advocacy programs. We are also looking for grants to expand our initiative and make it more democratic.

The primary objective of Season of Docs is to create high-quality technical documentation for our open-source projects, including contributor guides, onboarding guides, community involvement, website documentation, tutorials, technical blogs, and more. Technical writers can review and edit existing documentation to ensure accuracy, currency, and ease of understanding.

As a technical writer, you will be writing blogs on Privacy Tech and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies such as Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Zero-Know Proofs, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, and various open-source privacy-preserving libraries like PySyft, OpenDP, Flower. The topics covered can range from Privacy Preserving Machine Learning to State of the art Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

Additionally, technical writers can help our open-source organizations develop a content strategy that identifies what documentation is necessary, who the target audience is, and how it should be delivered. They can also conduct user research to understand the target audience's needs and challenges and create documentation that addresses those needs. Finally, technical writers can assist in translating documentation into different languages to make it available to a broader audience.

####  Project Scope/Idea 

The scope of this project is to improve the documentation, onboarding process, and technical content of the open-source Documentation initiative, licensed under Apache 2.0. The project aims to attract and enable privacy researchers, data scientists, developers, policymakers, industry leaders, and organizations to use and contribute to the initiative for advancing the field of privacy tech and privacy-enhancing technologies. The project scope includes the following

- Documentation Development: The project aims to create high-quality technical documentation for the initiative's open-source projects, including contributor guides, onboarding guides, community involvement, website documentation, tutorials, and technical blogs. Technical writers will review and edit the existing documentation to ensure accuracy, currency, and ease of understanding.
- Technical Blogs: The project scope includes writing technical blogs on Privacy Tech and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies such as Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Zero-Know Proofs, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, and various open-source privacy-preserving libraries like PySyft, OpenDP, Flower. Technical writers will cover a wide range of topics, from Privacy Preserving Machine Learning to State of the art Privacy Enhancing Technologies.
- Content Strategy: Technical writers will help the initiative's open-source organizations develop a content strategy that identifies what documentation is necessary, who the target audience is, and how it should be delivered.
- User Research: Technical writers will conduct user research to understand the target audience's needs and challenges and create documentation that addresses those needs.
- Localization: Technical writers will assist in translating the initiative's documentation into different languages to make it available to a broader audience.
- State-of-the-art Reports: The project aims to publish state-of-the-art reports on privacy tech and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), as well as open research/advocacy programs.
- Grant Funding: The project seeks to secure grant funding to expand the initiative and make it more democratic.


#### Measuring your projectâ€™s success

- Documentation Quality: The quality of the documentation created or updated will be evaluated based on its accuracy, completeness, and usefulness to the target audience.
- Technical Blog Engagement: The success of the technical blogs will be measured by tracking engagement metrics such as views, shares, and comments.
- Content Strategy Effectiveness: The effectiveness of the content strategy will be evaluated based on the feedback from the initiative's open-source organizations and the target audience.
- User Research Feedback: The feedback received from the target audience through user research will be used to evaluate the success of the project in addressing the needs and pain points of the target audience.
- Localization Metrics: The success of the localization efforts will be measured by tracking engagement metrics such as views, shares, and comments in different languages.
- State-of-the-art Reports and Research Feedback: The effectiveness of the state-of-the-art reports and research programs will be evaluated based on the feedback received from the target audience and the open-source community.
- Grant Funding: The success of the project in securing grant funding will be measured by the amount of funding secured and the feedback received from the grantors.
