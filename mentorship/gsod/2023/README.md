## About OpenPrivacyTech

OpenPrivacyTech is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit open-source organization dedicated to democratizing privacy technology and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Our mission is to make privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) accessible to everyone through education, research, and advocacy. Our goal is to advance the field of privacy tech by conducting research, identifying emerging trends and technologies, developing standards and infrastructure for the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). We work with researchers, data scientists, developers, policymakers, industry leaders, and organizations to advocate for strong data privacy and protection laws while promoting the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). 

At OpenPrivacyTech, we firmly believe in the critical importance of protecting individual privacy, and we are dedicated to promoting privacy tech adoption and joined the movement toward building and adopting for privacy-enhacing technologies. By collaborating with key stakeholders and promoting best practices in privacy tech, we are working to build a safer, more equitable digital future for all. 

We are excited to participate in the Season of Docs 2023 program and hire technical writers to create and update our documentation and technical content, such as contributor and onboarding guides, tutorials, technical resources, blog posts, and over all organizations open source project documentations . We believe in open source, adopting open standards, and building an open community to raise awareness of emerging privacy-enhancing technologies. By participating in the Season of Docs, we hope to support our contributors and technical writers and help grow our nonprofit initiative.


### About Project


#### Your project’s problem

_Tell us about the problem your project will help solve. Why is it important to your organization or project to solve this problem?_


#### Your project’s scope

_Tell us about what documentation your organization will create, update, or improve. If some work is deliberately not being done, include that information as well. Include a time estimate, and whether you have already identified organization volunteers and a technical writer to work with your project._


#### Measuring your project’s success

_How will you know that your new documentation has helped solve your problem? What metrics will you use, and how will you track them?_


### Project budget

#### General guidelines

*   You can include your budget in your proposal, or as a separate link. If your budget is fewer than ten items, we recommend including it in your proposal.
*   All budgets should be in US dollars. We expect grants to range from US$5000 to US$15000; if your project is outside of that range, please provide additional information to justify your budget.
*   We expect the bulk of your budget (60-70% minimum) to be allocated to the technical writer working on your project. We recommend budgeting on a per-project basis wherever possible.
*   We expect open source projects to use open source tools whenever possible; if your project absolutely requires funds for proprietary software licenses or support, please include a justification for the amount.
*   Other possible expenses include:
    *   Design work to create branding, logos, templates, or other design assets for your documentation site
    *   Minimal amounts (&lt;US$200) for project swag (t-shirts or stickers for your participants). If you use the Season of Docs logo, it must be accompanied by your project or organization logo or name. Your swag may **not** use the name Google.
    *   Minimal stipends for volunteers who take on considerable mentorship or guidance roles in the project (we recommend no more than $500 per volunteer, please)
    *   Downstream donations to other open source projects should be no more than 10% of your budget total.
*   Include other budget items as needed, along with justification for the amount sought. Expense justifications should highlight how the expenditure will contribute to the success of the project as a whole.
