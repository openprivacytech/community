# Google Season of Docs 2023

### PROPOSAL TITLE - Update OpenPrivacyTech Contributor Guide, Documentations and Technical Contents.

_Your proposal title should be short and specific. “Update ORGNAME Contributor Guide” is a good proposal title. “Documentation Improvements” is too vague; “Update Sections 5,7,23,99 of Contributor Guide, Create FAQ, and Create Style Guide” is too long._


### About your organization

OpenPrivacyTech is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit initiative working on democratizing privacy tech. 





_In this section, tell us about your organization or project in a few short paragraphs. What problem does your project solve? Who are your users and contributors? How long has your organization or project been in existence? Give some context to help us understand why funding your proposal would create a positive impact in open source and the world._


### About your project


#### Your project’s problem

_Tell us about the problem your project will help solve. Why is it important to your organization or project to solve this problem?_


#### Your project’s scope

_Tell us about what documentation your organization will create, update, or improve. If some work is deliberately not being done, include that information as well. Include a time estimate, and whether you have already identified organization volunteers and a technical writer to work with your project._


#### Measuring your project’s success

_How will you know that your new documentation has helped solve your problem? What metrics will you use, and how will you track them?_


### Project budget

#### General guidelines

*   You can include your budget in your proposal, or as a separate link. If your budget is fewer than ten items, we recommend including it in your proposal.
*   All budgets should be in US dollars. We expect grants to range from US$5000 to US$15000; if your project is outside of that range, please provide additional information to justify your budget.
*   We expect the bulk of your budget (60-70% minimum) to be allocated to the technical writer working on your project. We recommend budgeting on a per-project basis wherever possible.
*   We expect open source projects to use open source tools whenever possible; if your project absolutely requires funds for proprietary software licenses or support, please include a justification for the amount.
*   Other possible expenses include:
    *   Design work to create branding, logos, templates, or other design assets for your documentation site
    *   Minimal amounts (&lt;US$200) for project swag (t-shirts or stickers for your participants). If you use the Season of Docs logo, it must be accompanied by your project or organization logo or name. Your swag may **not** use the name Google.
    *   Minimal stipends for volunteers who take on considerable mentorship or guidance roles in the project (we recommend no more than $500 per volunteer, please)
    *   Downstream donations to other open source projects should be no more than 10% of your budget total.
*   Include other budget items as needed, along with justification for the amount sought. Expense justifications should highlight how the expenditure will contribute to the success of the project as a whole.
